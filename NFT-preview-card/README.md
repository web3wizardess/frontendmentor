## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The most challenging part of the coding experience was to apply the background 'hover' effect over the main image. I learned that creating an 'overlay' is the best way to apply this. The method I thought would work using 'z-index' did not, I discovered through the process that the 'opacity' function would work. I also took some time to discover how to get the icons next to the price and timer to stay level with the text which I achieved with the 'relative' position.
