### What I learned

The most challenging part of the coding experience was to apply the background 'hover' effect over the main image. I learned that creating an 'overlay' is one way to apply this. The method I thought would work using 'z-index' did not, I discovered through the process that the 'opacity' function would work. I also took some time to discover how to get the icons next to the price and timer to stay level with the text which I achieved with the 'relative' position.

*update*
I learnt a more useful way of applying the 'hover' effect without using overlay. Credit to @AdrianoEscarabote for his code. He applied the image as a background and used box-shadow effect to create the filter effect. I've totally stolen this useful code. I'll remember this method in future.


### Useful resources

- [tsbsankara YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8) - Watching someone else code the project after I completed mine helped me to find alternative ways of coding the project. 
- [MrCoder YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sxh57ifSQ) - Another YouTuber who helped me see how another person would code it live.
- [@AdrianoEscarabote](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/AdrianoEscarabote) Adriano gave me some really useful info on FrontendMentor & helped me to adjust my code. I found more useful ways of applying methods by reading his code & suggestions.
